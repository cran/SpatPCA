## SpatPCA v1.3.0.0 (Release date: 2021-01-31)
#### Overview 
In this release, we take care of the perspective of software quality by refactoring code for better readability and adding unit-tests. Accordingly, we add multiple features by separating implicit functions from `spatpca`.

#### NEW FEATURES
1. `thinPlateSplineMatrix()` for producing a thin-plane spline matrix
2. `predictEigenfunction()`for estimating K dominant patterns on new sites
3. `predict()` for predicting new target variable `Y` on new sites   
4. `plot()` for `spatpca` objects for plotting M-fold CV results

#### MAINTENANCE
- Add unit tests with code coverage `87%`
